# **About**
<br>
This project had been designed to be a B2C e-commerce store to raise funds and supplies for a animal rescue charity. The products offered are for the consumer to donate food, toys or donations to the rescue through the site. It also has a section for dogs looking for homes, information on the charity and general useful information for those thinking of adopting or volunteering. This was added to further engage users in the product and as a site to visit to get information on the charity and what we do. These posts with dogs for adoption should be constantly updating and so inform the public through the marketing strategy.

This project was built as the final portfolio submission for the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Higher National Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

# **Business Model**
<br>
The project had been based in Business to Consumer (B2C) style. It is an e-commerce where the consumer can find options to donate specific items to the charity.

<br>

## **Marketing Strategy**
<br>

### **SEO**
Several SEO techniques were undertaken in order to ensure the site ranks highly in search engine results. Also the files robots.txt and sitemap.xml had been included. The sitemap.xml file had been created using 

[xml-sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)

**Keywords:**
<br>
Starting with a brain storm of keywords that are relevant to the e-commerce itself. And reduced by making use of a word search so as to target the more relevant, the site I had used is 

[wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/)

**Content marketing:**
<br>
The information and description of the products in the site had been kept the more relevant to the site purpose. Also the keywords had been taken into account when creating things like categories and such, so insure they are present without getting to be considered as spam. 
Each page has its own title, and finally meta tag description had been included in the base so that every page contains them.


**Social Media Marketing: Facebook**
<br>
The e-commerce has its own Facebook, the one that will keep posting a minimum of three times a week, and releasing alerts of monthly offers and benefits, which are sent by e-mail to the subscribers. This is for to motivate the subscription to our newsletter and increase the clients database.

# Project

## Project Management

An agile methodology was used to plan and develop the Wicklow Animal Welfare project. All the main features of the application were recorded and refined into user stories. These user stories were created and stored as GitHub issues and then mapped into iterations to help to plan and allocate the workload. 

[Back to top](<#contents>)

### GitHub Project Board

All the user stories were added to a GitHub project board to assist with tracking progress. All user stories started in the to-do section. On completion, each user story was moved into the done section and marked as closed.

## Site Structure

The site structure for Wicklow Animal Welfare was kept simple and user-friendly to avoid confusion. The main site nav bar and is present on every page of the site to allow for easy access to site navigation. Non-authenticated users have limited access to pages within the site, and this is reflected in the changing state of the nav menus. Non logged in users only have access to certain areas and log-in / sign-up auth pages are clearly labelled. Authenticated users can access commenting, liking and their profile page with admin users able to change the database on the front end. 

[Back to top](<#contents>)

## Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was kept simple with gray and pale green mostly used and pops of colour from the images through the site.

Wicklow Animal Welfare uses [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for its typography. The font utilised is Montserrat.

The 404 page is triggered when a user navigates to a site URL which doesn't exist. This could be because of a number of reasons, including a faulty link or an expired URL. Most users will not see this page, but it is there as a backup for users who encounter these rare errors. The purpose of the 404 page is to notify the user that there has been an error, and the page that they have tried to access cannot be found.

## Bugs

* Several bug were fixed throughout the testing process. Buttons were displaying with an overlap on small screen sizes which was due to an error with the bootstrap used. There was an issue with the messages not popping up. This was discovered to be related to the mailchimp javascript and was resolved when this was moved to the footer template rather than the base template. 

* The shopping bag was allowing the decrement buttons to select minus amount of product. When updated this just removes the item from the bag so is not affecting checkout. This was fixed.

* Issues with adding rating functionality need further work. Logged in users can leave a rating, however this is not saved and does not change average rating. As this was not key to website and due to timing issues this was not rectified.

* Issue with webhooks was found to be due to an error in the WH secret key.

# Deployment

## Creating the Django app

1. Go to the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template [Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
2. Click on Use This Template and click Gitpod
3. Install Django and gunicorn: `pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn`
4. Install supporting database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2 library: `pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2`
5. Create file for requirements: in the terminal window type `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
6. Create project: in the terminal window type django-admin startproject your_project_name
7. Create app: in the terminal window type python3 manage.py startapp your_app_name
8. Add app to the list of installed apps in settings.py file: you_app_name
9. Migrate changes: in the terminal window type python3 manage.py migrate
10. Run the server to test if the app is installed, in the terminal window type python3 manage.py runserver
11. If the app has been installed correctly the window will display The install worked successfully! Congratulations!

## Deployment of This Project

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com) and select New in the top right corner and Create New App from dropdown. 
2. Create app name and select region and create app
3. Create a database on ElephantSQL by logging in and creating a new instance. Give your plan a name and select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan. Select region and datacentre, click review and create instance. 
4. Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project. In the URL section, click the copy icon to copy the database URL. 
5. In your project workspace, create a file called env.py and ensure this file is in your gitignore.
6. Add env.py file to your settings.py. Further down your settings.py file remove the insecure secret key provided by Django and replace with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`. Replace database in settings with `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`. Add secret key and database information to env.py file and migrate changes. 
7. Create a cloudinary account and copy your API authentication information. Add this to your env.py file under `CLOUDINARY_URL`. Add cloudinary libraries to settings.py file. Also add `STATICFILES_STORAGE` with `Cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage` and use `os.path.join` to connect our base directory to static and set up static route. Do the same for media URL with `Cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage`.
8. Create a stripe account and copy the Publishable Key and add it as variable to the env.py and set the variable for it in settings. Repeat with Secret Key.
9. Click on webhooks in stripe and "Add Endpoint". Follow the instructions to add the url + '/checkout/wh'. Select the listener events and save it. Repeat step 8 with this new key, the STRIPE_WH_SECRET variable. These 3 keys will go into Heroku config vars.
10. At the top of settings.py and under the base directory add `TEMPLATES_DIR =  os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')` and change the D-I-R-S key in template setting to point towards the new templates directory variable. 
11. Add Heroku host name into allowed hosts in settings.py file. Also add localhost. 
12. Create a Procfile `web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi`
13. Go back to Heroku and open settings tab. Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with SECRET_KEY, a new record with the `CLOUDINARY_URL` a new record with the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`, a new record with the DATABASE_URL, PORT set to 8000.
14. Select Github as the deployment method and confirm you want to connect to GitHub
15. Search for the repository name and click the connect button
16. Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select the preferred deployment type
17. Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github

## Final Deployment 

1. Create a runtime.txt `python-3.8.13`
2. When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in settings.py
3. In this project the summernote editor was used so for this to work in Heroku add: `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = SAMEORIGIN `to settings.py.
4. In Heroku settings, delete the config vars for `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`
