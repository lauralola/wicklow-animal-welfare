# **About**
<br>
This project had been designed to be a B2C e-commerce store to raise funds and supplies for a animla rescue charity. The products offered are for the consumer to donate food, toys or donations to the resuce through the site. It also has a section for dogs looking for homes, information on the charity and general useful information for those thinking of adopting or volunteering. This was added to further engage users in the product and as a site to visit to get information on the charity and what we do. These posts with dogs for adoption should be constantly updating and so inform the public through the marketing strategy.

This project was built as the final portfolio submission for the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Higher National Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

# **Bussines Model**
<br>
The project had been based in Business to Consumer (B2C) style. It is an e-commerce where the consumer can find options to donate specific items to the charity.
<br>

## **Marketing Strategy**
<br>

### **SEO**
Several SEO techniques were undertaken in order to ensure the site ranks highly in search engine results. Also the files robots.txt and sitemap.xml had been included. The sitemap.xml file had been created using 

[xml-sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)

**Keywords:**
<br>
Starting with a brain storm of keywords that are relevant to the e-commerce itself. And reduced by making use of a word search so as to target the more relevant, the site I had used is 

[wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/)

**Content marketing:**
<br>
The information and description of the products in the site had been kept the more relevant to the site purpose. Also the keywords had been taken into account when creating things like categories and such, so insure they are present without getting to be considere as spam. 
Each page has its own title, and finally meta tag description had been included in the base so that every page contains them.


**Social Media Marketing: Facebook**
<br>
The e-commerce has its own facebook, the one that will keep posting a minimun of three times a week, and releasing alerts of monthly offers and benefits, which are sent by e-mail to the subscribers. This is for to motivate the subscription to our newsletter and increase the clients database.

<br>

<br>

**Email Marketing**
This will be based in our newsletter service and also to the users that had purchased with us previously. The starting strategy is to produce a monthly mail with new arrivals and deals, also will contain some news about the gaming world, etc.
Subscribed users will recieve a welcome mail informing benefits will that be coming in future mails. This refering to the monthly mail with deals, so the user does not feel overwhelmed or spammed. 
For now there is a basic mail, but in future a better design will be implemented. Also had been set for the staff to recieve a daily report from mailchimp so to keep track of the traffic on it.

Also when the user registers for an account in the app will recieve a welcome email with some information about benefits and promoting our newsletter on it.

# Project

## Project Management

An agile methodology was used to plan and develop the Wicklow Animal Welfare project. All the main features of the application were recorded and refined into user stories. These user stories were created and stored as GitHub issues and then mapped into iterations to help to plan and allocate the workload.

### GitHub Project Board

![Project Board](readme/images/project-board.png)

All the user stories were added to a GitHub project board to assist with tracking progress. All user stories started in the to-do section. On completion, each user story was moved into the done section and marked as closed.

Authenticated users can access commenting, liking and their profile page with admin users able to change the database on the front end.

### Search Results Page

* A user can user the search bar tool to find relevant products. They are displayed below a message informing the user that if not results found please try another. If the user clicks the search button on an empty enquiry they will be informed that they forgot to search. This currently just searches products but a future feature could be to search all apps.

### 404 Page

![404 Page](readme/images/404-page.png)

The 404 page is triggered when a user navigates to a site URL which doesn't exist. This could be because of a number of reasons, including a faulty link or an expired URL. Most users will not see this page, but it is there as a backup for users who encounter these rare errors. The purpose of the 404 page is to notify the user that there has been an error, and the page that they have tried to access cannot be found.

## Future Features

1. Further functionality to search the site. 

2. A user could have the functionality to completely delete their account along with any related content. 

3. An events section could be added so users can fundraising events.

4. Rating section could be implemented.

### Browser Tests

The Gear Addict site has been tested on Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge and Brave. Unfortunately, there is an unresolved error that is present on Safari. Due to Safari blocking cross-site tracking, the cookies used in the project are disabled, therefore preventing communication between the API and the front-end. Turning this setting off in the browser settings does resolve the problem, but this is a temporary fix. This bug is also present in the Code Institute walkthrough project. To resolve this in the future I will combine the front and back-end repositories into one and use a singular URL. But other than this, no browser errors were detected.

### Lighthouse Tests

The Gear Addict site has been tested using the [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) [Lighthouse Tester](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) and has returned very good results. Performance ratings on the first lighthouse tests were lower due to large images. This was resolved by resizing and compressing the images. The final page test results can be found below.

## Bugs

A number of bugs presented themselves during the Gear Addict development process. Most of these bugs were resolved, but unfortunately due to time constraints, some of them weren't. This section will list the resolved and unresolved bugs.

[Back to top](<#contents>)

### Resolved

1. When the create rig form was first implemented, the image fields were not submitting unless all the fields had an image attached. The bug was caused by the image form data appends inside the on submit function not containing conditionals to check for an image. The bug was resolved by adding turnary conditionals into the image append methods to check for current files.

2. During development of the users profiles, there was a temporary bug when becoming a fan of another user through the popular profiles component. Becoming a fan of a user while on a user page was working as expected, but becoming a fan of a user while on the owner profile page was incrementing the idols count on the profile rather than the fan count. This bug was caused by incrementing the wrong field in the utils fanhelper and fanunhelper functions. The bug was resolved by incrementing the idols count in the profile is owner conditional instead of the fans count. 

[Click here to view the bug fix commit](https://github.com/Matthew-Hurrell/gear-addict/commit/6d634a89e13b897c77b6b55552fa177a15181a2f)

3. Later in development, a bug was discovered in the profile details edit form where the header image was overwriting the profile image field. This meant that when a header image was added and submitted in the profile edit form the profile header was being added into the profile image section. This was caused by a typo in the profile edit form appending the header image field to the profile image form data. The bug was resolved by simply changing the form data name to header_image to match the header field name. 

[Click here to view the bug fix commit](https://github.com/Matthew-Hurrell/gear-addict/commit/806779b6aef73a818ec7f124546f523eeea8ff1f)

4. A bug was also discovered on the homepage hottest rigs list. During development there was a duplicate rig being displayed within the list. Originally it was thought that the bug was being caused by the slice method, but it was discovered that this was originating from the axios response, which was returning two of the same rig. This issue was only visible when there were limited rigs on the database. To resolve this I changed the query to display rigs in descending like count order and then added more rigs. This seemed to resolve the problem. 

[Back to top](<#contents>)

### Unresolved

1. There is currently an ongoing issue with the Gear Addict project on Safari, which unfortunately hasn't been resolved. This is a problem which has been inherited form the Code Institute walkthrough Moments project. Regretfully, Safari blocks cross-domain cookies and prevents cross-site tracking, and as the back and front-end of this project are on different domains, the site relies on cookies for communication. This prevents communication between the front and back-end of this project on Safari and impedes the site functioning correctly. The issue can be temporarily fixed by turning off the prevent cross site tracking and cookie options within Safari, but obviously this isn't ideal as users cannot be expected to do this for the site to function correctly. As I intend to use this project for my portfolio, I will seek to resolve this issue moving forward by combining both repositories and deploying them both to one domain. This should resolve the issue in the future.

# Acknowledgements

This application was created as a final portfolio project submission for the Code Institute Higher National Diploma in Software Development. The course has lasted a year and has consisted of five major projects spread out throughout the year. It has been a very intense but rewarding year and I couldn't be more thankful to the Code Institute team for making my re-entry back into education a great experience. I have learnt more than I thought was possible over the last year, and I have fallen in love with my career and the tech industry. I am now working full time as a developer and I am happy to say, I do really love my job. 

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has encouraged and supported me over the last year. It has certainly been a challenging year, but I wouldn't change anything. Thank you very much to Code Institute for helping and supporting career changers like myself to get into the tech industry. Thank you to my incredibly talented mentor [Martina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinaterlevic/) for all your help and advice with the last project. Thank you to the Slack community for guidance and support and allowing me to occasionally vent my stress in an understanding and empathetic environment! Finally, thank you to my family and my incredibly patient girlfriend for your belief in me and encouragement to pursue my aspirations. I love and appreciate you all.

Best wishes and happy coding,

Matthew Hobbs-Hurrell
